## FAQ
Q: **What is File Find and how does it work?**

A: File Find is an open-source macOS Utility, that makes it easy to find Files. To search fill in the filters you need and leave the filters you don't need empty.

Q: **Why does File Find sometimes freeze?**

A: It is possible that for example reloading Files or Building the UI at the end of a search can cause File Find to freeze.

Q: **How to clean the Cache?**

A: File Find is saving the cache under `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Application Support/File-Find/Cached Searches`. The Cache gets cleaned up on start up, that means to clean the cache just restart File Find

Q: **Why does File Find ask for permission for Contacts, Calenders, Photos, Downloads, etc...?**

A: File Find scans the entire specified directory, even if files are excluded they are scanned first and then sorted out. 
Your photos, calendar data, contacts etc. are stored in a library folder, which means that File Find scans them. 
**File Find does not connect to the internet**, everything stays on your machine. If you are still uncomfortable, you can also press "Do not allow", the associated files will not appear in your searches. **If File Find asks for your Downloads or Desktop folder, you can decline, File Find will still be able to scan those files.**
