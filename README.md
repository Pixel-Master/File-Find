## FAQ
Q: **What is File Find and how does it work?**

A: File Find is an open-source macOS Utility, that makes it easy to find files. To search fill in the filters you need and leave the filters you don't need empty.

Q: **Why does File Find sometimes freeze?**

A: It is possible that for example reloading files or building the UI at the end of a search can cause File Find to freeze. Just wait a minute!

Q: **How do you clean the cache?**

A: File Find stores the cache under `/Users/$USERNAME/Library/Application Support/File-Find/Cached Searches`. You can clean the cache with `âŒ˜ + T` or `Tools > Clear Cache`. In the About section you can set when the cache gets cleaned automatically.

Q: **Why does File Find ask for permission for Contacts, Calenders, Photos, etc...?**

A: File Find scans the entire specified directory, even if files are excluded they are scanned first and then sorted out. 
Your photos, calendar data, contacts etc. are stored in a library folder, which means that File Find scans them. 
File Find does not connect to the internet, everything stays on your machine. You can also press "Do not allow", the associated files will not appear in your searches.

Q: **Why does File Find ask for permission for Downloads, Desktop, Documents, etc...?**

A: On macOS if an app scans a directory this popup will automatically appear.
If you press "Don't allow", File Find will still be able to scan those files,
but you are not going to be able to save searches in those directories

Q: **Does File Find connect to the Internet?**

A: **File Find does not connect to the Internet**, everything stays on your machine.
